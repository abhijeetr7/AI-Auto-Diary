# AI-Auto-Diary

How to Use:
Paste Events: In the "Your Calendar Events" text area, paste your daily schedule or event details. Each line can represent a separate event.

Generate: Click the "Generate Diary Entry" button. The application will send your events to the Gemini API (simulating a "GPT summary generator") and populate the "Your Daily Journal Entry" section with a summarized diary entry.

Edit: Click the "Edit Entry" button to switch the journal entry into an editable text area. Make any changes you like.

Save: After editing, click the "Save Entry" button (which was previously "Edit Entry") to save your changes and switch back to display mode.

Download: Click "Download" to save your journal entry as a .txt file.

Print: Click "Print" to open your browser's print dialog and print the journal entry.

This application provides a user-friendly interface with responsive design using Tailwind CSS and includes a custom message box instead of alert() for better user experience.
